  <h1>Unsing Internal CSS</h1>
  <h3>"Style" tag</h3>
  <p>You can also include CSS rules
within an HTML page by placing
them inside a style element,
which usually sits inside the
head element of the page.
The style element should use
the type attribute to indicate
that the styles are specified in
CSS. The value should be text/
css.</p>

<h1>Sometimes you might consider placing CSS rules in the same page as your HTML code.</h1>

<p>If you are just creating a single
page, you might decide to put
the rules in the same file to
keep everything in one place.
(However, many authors would
consider it better practice to
keep the CSS in a separate file.)</p>

<p>If you have one page which
requires a few extra rules (that
are not used by the rest of the
site), you might consider using
CSS in the same page. (Again,
most authors consider it better
practice to keep all CSS rules in a
separate file.)</p>

<p>Most of the examples in this
book place the CSS rules in the
"head" of the document (using
the "style" element) rather
than a separate document. This
is simply to save you opening
two files to see how the CSS
examples work.</p>
