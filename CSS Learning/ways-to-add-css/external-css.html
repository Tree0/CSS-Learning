  <h1> Using External CSS </h1>
  <h3>"link" tag </h3>
 <p>The link tag element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page. It is an
empty element (meaning it does not need a closing tag), and it lives inside the "head" tag element.It should use three attributes:
</p>

<h1>Why use External Style Sheets?</h1>
<p>All of your web pages can share
the same style sheet. This is
achieved by using the "link"
element on each HTML page of
your site to link to the same CSS
document. This means that the
same code does not need to be
repeated in every page (which
results in less code and smaller
HTML pages).</p>

<p>Therefore, once the user has
downloaded the CSS stylesheet,
the rest of the site will load
faster. If you want to make a
change to how your site appears,
you only need to edit the one
CSS file and all of your pages
will be updated. For example,
you can change the style of
every "h1" element by altering</p>

<p>the one CSS style sheet, rather
than changing the CSS rules on
every page. The HTML code
will be easier to read and edit
because it does not have lots of
CSS rules in the same document.
It is generally considered good
practice to have the content of
the site separated from the rules
that determine how it appears.</p>
